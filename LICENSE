3. Definition of analogue and independent expert commission

An analogue is a mod that basically copies the following three aspects of a given mod:

Functionality: If more than 50% of the game mechanics or functionality of your mod are similar to the original mod, it will be considered a borrowing of functionality.
GUI: Any copying of GUI elements such as icons, buttons, panels, and other visual elements without significant changes will be considered an infringement.
Block textures: Using original or slightly modified block textures from this mod without permission from the author is also considered creating an analogue.

If all three aspects are present in your mod, it will be considered a complete analogue. The creation of analogues without the written consent of the author is strictly prohibited.

To determine whether a mod is an analogue, an independent expert commission will be assembled. This commission will include experienced modders and community representatives who will analyze the functionality, interface, and textures of the mod. The commission’s evaluation will be based on an in-depth comparison, and their decision will be final and not subject to appeal.

If all three aspects are present in your mod, it will be considered complete analogue. The creation of analogues without the written consent of the author is strictly prohibited.

4. Applying conditions to all versions of the mod

This license and its terms apply to all versions of the mod: both current and all previous and future releases. Regardless of changes made to the mod over time, the terms of this license remain unchanged. Any updates to the mod do not cancel or change the terms of its use.

5. Official requirements for use
You are obliged to keep all links to the author and download source in any publications and distributions of the mod.
Changes to code, textures or game mechanics are permitted only if all permissions and conditions described above are met.
Any changes that may affect key elements of the mod must be agreed in advance with the author.
6. Liability and restrictions

The author of the mod is not responsible for:

Any technical problems, errors or glitches encountered while using the mod. If problems are found, it is recommended to contact the mod's official GitHub repository for support or bug reporting.
The mod is incompatible with other mods or game versions.

The use of the mod, its modification and distribution is carried out by users at their own peril and risk. The author reserves the right to make changes to the license terms for future versions of the mod.
