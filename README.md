This allows you to obtain resources by cultivating plants. Crops can be improved through crossbreeding two or more species, or by using genetic technologies to create the perfect variant.](https://i.postimg.cc/3wWCNkhM/preview-12.png) ![Crop and bee](https://i.postimg.cc/2yN40TZm/preview-13.png) ![The mod adds 5 types of bees, each tied to specific biomes. Their mechanics differ greatly from vanilla. Bees are now divided into 4 types: gatherer, builder, healer, and defender — each performing its own unique role. Over time, they can mutate and also accelerate crop growth.
With prolonged crop growth acceleration, bees can produce additional loot besides honey and royal jelly.](https://i.postimg.cc/9f4ZVsPC/preview-14.png) ![The mod offers a wide variety of armor — from basic to energy-powered (nano-spectral).
