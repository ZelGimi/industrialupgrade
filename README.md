## **Industrial Upgrade**

**Industrial Upgrade** is a global technology mod that diversifies your survival in Minecraft, from simple technologies to large farms and massive structures. The mod significantly complicates the game, extending survival time. It is recommended for players who like to think through systems and dive into various technologies! This rethinking and purification of the legacy of Industrialcraft²

## 💡 **Why choose Industrial Upgrade?**

This mod makes the game more challenging, interesting, and… much more exciting! It will provide you with hours of survival, force you to think strategically, and develop complex systems.  
**Recommended for players who enjoy challenges and want to immerse themselves in the wonderful world of technologies!**

**Industrial Upgrade** is designed as a standalone mod. The mod team respects the achievements of other developers, such as **IndustrialCraft²**, and we consider our mod a spiritual successor in this direction.  
However, all mechanics, textures, and program code are created by us from scratch and do not use any assets from **IndustrialCraft²**.

## 🔧 **The mod is divided into 4 main development stages:**

1.  🪓 **Primitive**  
    Take your first steps in industrial evolution using the simplest mechanisms and tools. This is your starting stage where you'll learn to work with basic resources and structures.
    
2.  🏭 **Steam**  
    At this stage, you'll learn to create steam engines that will allow you to deploy more powerful mechanisms and production processes. Steam energy is the foundation of your growth!
    
3.  ⚡ **Electric**  
    Move on to electricity! This stage is divided into several tiers:
    
    *   **Basic** — The basics of electricity and simple mechanisms powered by energy.
    *   **Improved** — More powerful mechanisms and upgraded energy sources.
    *   **Advanced** — Complex systems and mechanisms with high performance.
    *   **Perfect** — Create nearly perfect electrical machines and devices.
    *   **Photon** — Reach the level of futuristic technologies with photon energy and super-powerful devices!
4.  ⚛️ **Quantum**  
    The highest level of development, where you will work with quantum technologies.
    

**Important!** Each new stage requires attention and proper preparation. If at any stage you lack energy or resources, it means you're not yet ready to move to the next level. Follow the logic and develop your technologies to avoid reaching a dead end!

**Industrial Upgrade** is not just a mod, it's a new reality where you can test yourself and your abilities in various technologies! Dive into the process and become a master of industrial evolution!

Some believe that Industrial Upgrade does not support old versions(1.4.x,2.x) simply because I wanted it so much. But in fact, the reason is different: IC2 developers at one time created barriers to independent modders and prevented the development of industrial technologies in Minecraft. Instead of fighting with With these restrictions, I decided to direct every effort to create a completely independent fashion , which does not depend on other people's solutions and moves forward in its own way.
